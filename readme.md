    This is a simple studying tools. To use it I recommed a list of frequency of the words in the choosen language.
    
## Methods

### getCryptedText(filePath)
    
    It just opens a file in filePath and removes the \n returning the text


### getFrequency(cryptedText)

    It returns a dictionary of the frequency of each character in cryptedText


### replaceStr(string, toReplace, replace)

    Returns a string replacing the characters toReplace for replace in the var string
    
### findSequence(cryptedText, sequence)
    
    Returns a dictionary of frequency of given sequence in cryptedText. Notice that in THIS CASE the character "@" replaces any character
